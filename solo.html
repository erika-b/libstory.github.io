<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>Just one voice--your voice--can be all it takes to make a podcast. With your voice, you can tell a story, make an argument, follow a line of reasoning, or crack everyone up. </p>

<h2>Examples?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.welcometonightvale.com/">Welcome to Night Vale</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.twoupproductions.com/shows/limetown">Limetown </a></p

<h4>Where do I begin?</h4>

<p>Come up with an idea and make a plan.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What story do you want to tell? </li>
  <li>Who could you tell a story about? </li>
  <li>What places could you tell a story about?  </li>
  <li>Which questions haunt you, plague you, enchant you? </li>
  <li>Which arguments could you sustain for an audience?</li>
  <li>What weird ideas do you have? </li>
  <li>Have you found yourself in funny situations?</li>
  <li>What do you imagine that’s funny? </li>
  <li>What’s the punchline? What’s the set up? How long is the set up?</li>
  <li>What is a story, anyway? What does it mean to make an argument? Does comedy always have to sound the same?  </li>
  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id=peacefulheated>
  <p>At the very least, submit this plan before the second synchronous meeting.</p>
  </div>
  </ul>

<p>Do some research about your story, commentary, or comedy. Brainstorm ideas by way of listing, freewriting, and bubble mapping.
</p>

<p>Write your script. In the biz, this is called your <strong>“Acts.”</strong> In general, a 5-7 minute podcast will call for a 500-700 word script. </p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id=tape>
<p>If possible, submit this recording before the second meeting.</p>
</div>

<p>Record yourself reading your Acts. The unedited recording you make is called your <strong>“Tape.”</strong> </p>

<p>Determine if you need music and sound design. </p>

<p>Create, license, or find Creative Commons music and sounds.</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id=sharethird>
<p>If you create music or sounds, decide whether or not you'd like to give them a Creative Commons designation.</p>
</div>

<p>Put everything together with Audacity--your Acts, Tracks, music, and sounds. <p>
  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id=sharethird>Share your draft before the third meeting.
  </div>

<p>Share the draft of your podcast and get feedback. Share it with your interview subject--or not. </p>

<p>Consider, reject, or incorporate feedback. Reflect on your process and the meaning of your podcast. Repeat previous steps.</p>

<p>In a spreadsheet, enter the metadata for all the files you created or used.</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id=spreadmeta>
<p> If you created music or sounds, and if you’ve given them a Creative Commons designation, make sure to enter that into your spreadsheet. Submit this before the end of the workshop.</p>
</div>

<p>Finish your complete transcript. Your complete transcript is the one you will provide for you audience. It will be a combination of your Acts and descriptions of any of the music and sounds you used.</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id=completetranscript>
<p>Submit this before the end of the workshop.</p>
</div>

<p>Decide, as a whole, whether or not your podcast should have a Creative Commons designation. </p>

<p>If you are going to put your podcasts online, do an audit of your online safety and security. Do you have safe passwords? Consider making passwords using the <a href="https://www.eff.org/dice">“diceware” method</a> and using <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/business-password-manager">LastPass</a>. If you Google yourself, what information do data brokers have about you? <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/remove-delete-yourself-from-the-internet/">Consider contacting data brokers and requesting they remove your information.</a>

<h4>But is this the only way to make a solo podcast?
</h4>

<p>No! You might find that by making musical compositions first, a story will come to you. Or perhaps you’ll come across some Creative Commons sounds online that jumpstart your creativity. You might think that something seems funny on the page--in your script--but once you start recording, maybe you’ll improvise and say something hilarious.</p>

<div class="card-body">
  <h5 class="card-title">Have you thought about...?</h5>
  <ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-primary"><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Can all users digest your content? Did you include a transcript with your recording? Think about users who may want to listen to your content but who are hard of hearing or deaf. How can they consume the information without hearing your production?</li>
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary"><strong>Preservation:</strong> You've put time and effort into your team production. Don't let the effort go to waste! Think about filling out your metadata spreadsheet and where and how you will archive your podcast (multiple locations = good!).</li>
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success"><strong>Open:</strong> Have you provided attribution for works you included in this podcast? Did you assign a license to the podcast itself? Think about how you are incorporating other works into this production, and how you intend others to use your work in the future.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning"><strong>Digital Identity, Safety & Privacy:</strong> Did you mention someone in your recording by name? Are there other personal identifiers that may have accidentally slipped through that others could use to target you, your panel, or those you discussed? Think about how what you do and say can be linked back to your identity.</li>
  </ul>
