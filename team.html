<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>Some small groups of people are so smart--or so funny--that they can regularly sustain an audience’s interest. For this genre of podcasting, it might seem that production is a simple as finding a snowball microphone and pressing record, but often lots of preparation and subtle editing go into it. </p>

<h2>Examples?</h2>

<h4>Where do I begin?</h4>

<p>Come up with an idea and make a plan.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who should be on the panel? What does everyone bring to it?</li>
  <li>Does the panel have a theme? What is it? </li>
  <li>Does the panel speak about the news? Or popular culture? Or academia? A particular discipline? Are a group of people helping to tell a fictional story? Where are the boundaries? </li>
  <li>Is the comedy you’re doing scripted? Or improvised? A combination? Does the comedy fall within a theme or genre? Or does it challenge themes and genres? </li>
  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id=peacefulheated>
  <p>At the very least, submit this plan before the second synchronous meeting.</p>
  </div>
  </ul>

<p>Do some research for your panel discussion or comedy.</p>

<p>Come up with prompts or questions for your panel discussion or comedy. n the biz, this is called your <strong>“Q Line.”</strong></p>

<p>Meet as a panel or comedy group and record your performance. Before you record, make sure to confirm good sound levels. Don’t be afraid to throw out your Q Line if it’s not working or if you improvisationally come across better conversation. To be recording is to be getting your <strong>“Tape.”</strong></p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id=tape>
<p>If possible, submit this recording before the second meeting.</p>
</div>

<p>Transcribe all your Tape. <a href="https://otranscribe.com/">O Transcribe</a> is a useful tool for this.</p>

<p>Review all your recordings and transcriptions, cut out the best parts, and organize them into <em>“Tracks.”</em> You might also need to write some <em>“Acts”</em> to serve as transitions. Your Acts are what you’ll use to set up or deal with your Tracks. </p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id=tracksacts>
<p>If possible, submit your Acts and Tracks before the second meeting.</p>
</div>

<p>Record yourself reading your Acts. </p>

<p>Determine if you need music and sound design. </p>

<p>Create, license, or find Creative Commons music and sounds.</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id=sharethird>
<p>If you create music or sounds, decide whether or not you'd like to give them a Creative Commons designation.</p>
</div>

<p>Put everything together with Audacity--your Acts, Tracks, music, and sounds. <p>
  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id=sharethird>Share your draft before the third meeting.
  </div>

<p>Share the draft of your podcast and get feedback.</p>

<p>Consider, reject, or incorporate feedback. Reflect on your process and the meaning of your podcast. Repeat previous steps.</p>

<p>In a spreadsheet, enter the metadata for all the files you created or used.</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id=spreadmeta>
<p> If you created music or sounds, and if you’ve given them a Creative Commons designation, make sure to enter that into your spreadsheet. Submit this before the end of the workshop.</p>
</div>

<p>Finish your complete transcript. Your complete transcript is the one you will provide for you audience. It will be a combination of your Acts, Tracks, and descriptions of any of the music and sounds you used.</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id=completetranscript>
<p>Submit this before the end of the workshop.</p>
</div>

<p>Decide, as a whole, whether or not your podcast should have a Creative Commons designation. </p>

<p>If you are going to put your podcasts online, do an audit of your online safety and security. Do you have safe passwords? Consider making passwords using the <a href="https://www.eff.org/dice">“diceware” method</a> and using <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/business-password-manager">LastPass</a>. If you Google yourself, what information do data brokers have about you? <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/remove-delete-yourself-from-the-internet/">Consider contacting data brokers and requesting they remove your information.</a>

<h4>But is this the only way to make a panel-discussion / team-comedy podcast?
</h4>

<p>No! The ways are infinite! You might find that you don’t have to--or don’t want to--edit your panel discussion at all. Getting your tape and Tracks might actually be as simple as pressing “record.”

<div class="card-body">
  <h5 class="card-title">Have you thought about...?</h5>
  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
    <li class="list-group-item-danger"><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Can all users digest your content? Did you include a transcript with your recording? Think about users who may want to listen to your content but who are hard of hearing or deaf. How can they consume the information without hearing your production?</li>
    <li class="list-group-item-info"><strong>Preservation:</strong> You've put time and effort into your team production. Don't let the effort go to waste! Think about filling out your metadata spreadsheet and where and how you will archive your podcast (multiple locations = good!).</li>
    <li class="list-group-item-success"><strong>Open:</strong> Have you provided attribution for works you included in this podcast? Did you assign a license to the podcast itself? Think about how you are incorporating other works into this production, and how you intend others to use your work in the future.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item-warning"><strong>Digital Identity, Safety & Privacy:</strong> Did you mention someone in your recording by name? Are there other personal identifiers that may have accidentally slipped through that others could use to target you, your panel, or those you discussed? Think about how what you do and say can be linked back to your identity.</li>
  </ul>
