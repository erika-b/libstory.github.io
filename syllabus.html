<p><em>Workshop:</em> Digital Storytelling through Podcasting</p>

<p><em>Duration:</em> August 6 - 24, 2018</p>

<p><em>Cohort:</em> Up to 15 students</p>

<p><em>Instructors:</em> <a href="mailto:libstory@uw.edu">Digital Storytelling Teaching Team</a> (Elliot Stevens, Perry Yee, Dovi Pati√±o, Erika Bailey)</p>

<h2>Course overview and objectives</h2>

<p>This intensive three-week workshop will guide you through the development of your own digital story through the lens of podcasting. You will discuss how you came to your research, what motivated you to become a researcher, and where your research is taking you. Stories may be told in the format of narratives, interviews, fiction, and non-fiction audio productions.</p>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Produce a short 3-5 minute podcast segment by recording, editing, reviewing, transcribing, and reflecting on your work.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Identify a number of tools, platforms, and strategies for developing and hosting a podcast.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Learn and practice strategies and best practices for interviewing and recording.</p>
<p>Your developed work will be used as a podcast segment in a culminating compendium of all student work composed into a single podcast episode produced by the Teaching Team.</p>
<p>Our workshop is a safe space for open discussions. We embrace and support diversity and inclusiveness within this workshop and at the UW Libraries. We hope to foster unique representations of ideas and experiences. This online workshop and its synchronous meeting sessions will remain welcoming and supportive to allow participants to thrive creatively as a researcher and online learner.</p>

<h2>Workshop requirements</h2>

<p>Students are expected to complete assignments by the listed due dates, actively participate in workshop discussions, and attend each live synchronous session as scheduled. During the course, students will share their progress and questions regarding their digital stories with the Teaching Team and fellow participants. Each student is expected to attend three 60-90 minute synchronous meetings, and one 60 minute listening party.</p>

<h2>Technical requirements</h2>

<p>Participants in this workshop are expected to participate in live, synchronous, virtual discussions. To effectively engage in these discussions, we ask students to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Create a <a href="http://zoom.us">Zoom account </a>and download the Zoom client.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Use a headset or earbuds for synchronous sessions.</p>
<p>This workshop utilizes a real-time collaboration and communication tool known as <a href="http://www.slack.com">Slack</a>. Participants will join a Slack team for this workshop and are encouraged to use this tool for discourse and discussion.</p>
<p>Students will record their narratives on audio recording equipment available to them through their affiliation with UW, or on personal equipment such as smartphones or similar devices. UW students have access to the <a href="https://stlp.uw.edu/">Student Tech Loan Program</a>, the Odegaard Library <a href="https://itconnect.uw.edu/learn/technology-spaces/sound-studio/">Sound Studio</a>, and the UW Libraries <a href="http://www.lib.washington.edu/media/equipment">Media Arcade</a>.</p>
