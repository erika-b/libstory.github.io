<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>According to <a href="https://training.npr.org/audio/so-you-want-to-start-a-podcast-read-this-first/">NPR</a>, if you are thinking about starting a podcast you first need to spend time thinking about what you want to make and who you're making it for. Indeed, you need to be <em>intentional</em> and <em>specific</em> about what you are about to set out to do and who will be listening to what you have to say.</p>

<p>This module will help you to start your podcast off on the right foot. And to do that, you will be tasked with completing the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R000z-CU1D-3kTg1yD3VELAKjaoE3bbxpzGzZQq61rQ/edit?usp=sharing">NPR Storytelling Project Blueprint</a> from <a href="http://training.npr.org/">NPR Training</a>. This document contains a 10-step process that will help you build a roadmap and increase your chances of setting realistic, authentic goals and keeping on a tight schedule in this workshop.</p>

<h2>Starting your project</h2>

<p>No matter what format your podcast takes, you will <em>always</em> be telling a story. Your story will manifest in the sound of your voice, the environments in your recording, the words on your script, and the editing of your project. What you say and what you do matters. But we realize that starting a podcast is no small feat and often comes with big ideas with no authentic and feasible way to scope those ideas and make them come to life. The NPR Project Blueprint will hopefully help you identify priorities and provide focus through this process. </p>

<p>To start working on your blueprint, go to the NPR Project Blueprint <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j17fdqMNEZKI-ybPJk_9wNC0WQEwF7haHr1Fhx0zFBU/edit"><em>master copy</em></a>. Once in Google Docs, go to the File menu and select <em>Make a copy...</em> to save it to your My Drive.<p>

<h2>Step 1: What are you calling this project?</h2>

<p>Read the overview, instructions, and advice on the first page of the NPR Project Blueprint. While you are welcome to gather the physical materials suggested in the instructions, we want you to fill in your responses directly in the document itself.</p>

<p>Brainstorm ideas in the text box on page 2.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Describe your project in one memorable sentence.</h2>

<p>We love the fact that the blueprint labels this step as a "statement of purpose" rather than an elevator pitch. Indeed, go ahead and jot down a single memorable sentence that encapsulates what your proejct is truly, or will be, about.</p>

<p>You may revisit this statement of purpose later to review and refine your statement once you have advanced further along in the blueprint.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Define your audience</h2>
