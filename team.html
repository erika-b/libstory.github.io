<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>Some small groups of people are so smart--or so funny--that they can regularly sustain an audience’s interest. For this genre of podcasting, it might seem that production is a simple as finding a snowball microphone and pressing record, but often lots of preparation and subtle editing go into it. </p>

<h2>Where do I begin?</h2>

<p>Come up with an idea and make a plan.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who should be on the panel? What does everyone bring to it?</li>
  <li>Does the panel have a theme? What is it? </li>
  <li>Does the panel speak about the news? Or popular culture? Or academia? A particular discipline? Are a group of people helping to tell a fictional story? Where are the boundaries? </li>
  <li>Is the comedy you’re doing scripted? Or improvised? A combination? Does the comedy fall within a theme or genre? Or does it challenge themes and genres? </li>  </ul>
  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id=peacefulheated>
At the very least, submit this plan before the second synchronous meeting. <span class="badge badge-secondary">Assignment</span>
  </div>


<p>Do some research for your panel discussion or comedy.</p>

<p>Come up with prompts or questions for your panel discussion or comedy. n the biz, this is called your <strong>“Q Line.”</strong></p>

<p>Meet as a panel or comedy group and record your performance. Before you record, make sure to confirm good sound levels. Don’t be afraid to throw out your Q Line if it’s not working or if you improvisationally come across better conversation. To be recording is to be getting your <strong>“Tape.”</strong></p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id=tape>
If possible, submit this recording before the second meeting. <span class="badge badge-secondary">Assignment</span>
</div>

<p>Transcribe all your Tape. <a href="https://otranscribe.com/">O Transcribe</a> is a useful tool for this.</p>

<p>Review all your recordings and transcriptions, cut out the best parts, and organize them into <em>“Tracks.”</em> You might also need to write some <em>“Acts”</em> to serve as transitions. Your Acts are what you’ll use to set up or deal with your Tracks. </p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id=tracksacts>
If possible, submit your Acts and Tracks before the second meeting. <span class="badge badge-secondary">Assignment</span>
</div>

<p>Record yourself reading your Acts. </p>

<p>Determine if you need music and sound design. </p>

<p>Create, license, or find Creative Commons music and sounds.</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id=sharethird>
If you create music or sounds, decide whether or not you'd like to give them a Creative Commons designation. <span class="badge badge-secondary">Assignment</span>
</div>

<p>Put everything together with Audacity--your Acts, Tracks, music, and sounds. <p>
  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id=sharethird>Share your draft before the third meeting. <span class="badge badge-secondary">Assignment</span>
  </div>

<p>Share the draft of your podcast and get feedback.</p>

<p>Consider, reject, or incorporate feedback. Reflect on your process and the meaning of your podcast. Repeat previous steps.</p>

<p>In a spreadsheet, enter the metadata for all the files you created or used.</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id=spreadmeta>
If you created music or sounds, and if you’ve given them a Creative Commons designation, make sure to enter that into your spreadsheet. Submit this before the end of the workshop. <span class="badge badge-secondary">Assignment</span>
</div>

<p>Finish your complete transcript. Your complete transcript is the one you will provide for you audience. It will be a combination of your Acts, Tracks, and descriptions of any of the music and sounds you used.</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id=completetranscript>
Submit this before the end of the workshop. <span class="badge badge-secondary">Assignment</span>
</div>

<p>Decide, as a whole, whether or not your podcast should have a Creative Commons designation. </p>

<p>If you are going to put your podcasts online, do an audit of your online safety and security. Do you have safe passwords? Consider making passwords using the <a href="https://www.eff.org/dice">“diceware” method</a> and using <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/business-password-manager">LastPass</a>. If you Google yourself, what information do data brokers have about you? <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/remove-delete-yourself-from-the-internet/">Consider contacting data brokers and requesting they remove your information.</a></p>

<h2>But is this the only way to make a panel-discussion / team-comedy podcast?
</h2>

<p>No! The ways are infinite! You might find that you don’t have to--or don’t want to--edit your panel discussion at all. Getting your tape and Tracks might actually be as simple as pressing “record.”

<div class="card-body">
  <h5 class="card-title">Have you thought about...?</h5>
  <ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-primary"><strong>Accessibility:</strong> How can hard of hearing users identify who is talking during the podcast? Think about including name identifiers in the transcript for clarity.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary"><strong>Preservation:</strong>Do all members have access to a recording? Think about sending multiple versions to each panel or team member.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success"><strong>Open:</strong> Did multiple members of your panel or team contribute to editing? Think about how to make the process a bit more open by using collaborative tools during this process.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning"><strong>Digital Identity, Safety & Privacy:</strong> Have all members of this production signed off on the content? Think about how sharing polarizing discussions such as political views may impact you or your team.</li>
