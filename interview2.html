<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This module will focus on the art of the interview. You might think that interviews can happen with immediacy. Heck, you watch news reporters every day out in the field interviewing political figures or show hosts chatting with the latest celebrity du jour. But look deeper into the actual work that goes into the interview process and you will find a lot of time goes into planning the logistics so interviews are timely and flow with precision.</p>

<h2>The assignment</h2>
<p>Compile a list of 5-10 interview questions for your interviewee.</p>

<h4>Preparation</h4>

<p>A part of you might be thinking, "Maybe I can go into this interview blind so I have the same experience as my listener?" Well, you're wrong. Primarily because there is a lot you need to do to prepare for this interview, but also because you're <em>not</em> the listener - you're the producer. As a producer, you have to go into your interview with some helpful strategies in your pocket that will solicit answers and help keep the conversation moving. </p>

<h4>Choosing your subjects</h4>

<p>The first thing you need to do is to carefully select the subjects you will interview. You may know someone with a compelling story but they also need to be able to articulate what makes their story compelling. If you've chosen someone who is a great talker, then you're off to a great start! If you've chosen someone who isn't a great talker, you need to establish some ground rules for the conversation. These rules pertain to both you AND the interviewee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Avoid jargon. If acronyms are used, ask the speaker to clarify what or who they are referencing. If there are specific terms mentioned that are not understandable by a layman, describe what you mean. </li>
  <li>Know what you're talking about. Not only does the interviewee need to know what they're talking about, the producer (YOU) should know where you want the conversation to go. Clarify your expecations to your subject to make sure you're on the same page.</li>
  <li>Do your homework. If you know the interviewee, you should be able to provide an introduction to who this person is and the type of work they do. The audience has zero context of who this person is so you should be comfortable setting the stage and introducing them to your interviewee.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Create a back and forth</h4>

<p>You're choosing an interviewee presumably because they know a little bit about your topic. It's also safe to assume your interviewee may be an expert in the topic. As such, we can surmise that this person could talk at length about the topic at hand. While this can be great from an information sharing perspective, your listener can easily become lost in this type of monologue. Your job as a producer is to guide the conversation and create a back and forth exchange. You don't necessarily need to structure and plan the entire interview (nor should you), but giving your interviewee a sense of direction in terms of conversation can be incredibly helpful to stay on topic.</p>

<h4>Where is the story?</h4>

<p>We all have stories and that includes your interviewee. As a producer, you want to tease these stories out of your guest. The most helpful way to spark storytelling is to ask your guest about stories that they find fascinating or entertaining as it relates to your topic. This provides a prompt to keep conversation flowing, or can help refocus a guest or discussion if it's gone too far off-topic.</p>

<h4>Share your questions before the interview</h4>

<p>If you've chosen this podcast track, it's likely that you aren't trying to capture any "gotcha" investigative reports in this workshop. On the contrary, it's more likely that you want to make your guest comfortable and ease them into the conversation so your recording sounds natural and free-flowing. A good way to help facilitate this kind of discussion is to share your list of interview questions before you record. This will give your guest an idea of where you want to go with the discussion, provide an opportunity to deeply think through respones, and allow them to do their own preparation for the interview. </p>

<h4>The long silence</h4>

<p>We know it's uncomfortable, but don't be afraid to let long silences happen. As awkward as it may be to let the silence go on, it's often the case that your guest will jump in and choose to fill the silence with even more background, context, or a surprising story. Instructors often use this tactic to allow students time to process the question, formulate an answer, then articulate that answer. It provides a space for students to take the risk of engaging. Your guest, too, may need space to fully articulate a response.</p>

<h4>Sample questions</h4>

<p>Here are some questions that can help you get started. You will want to adapt them for your own personal spin on the interview, but this small sampling of questions can help you start processing how to approach starting an interview:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How did you get started in the field? Talk me through it.</li>
  <li>Why is this so important (to you, to us, to the world)?</li>
  <li>What are some common myths associated with this topic?</li>
  <li>What problems do we face if we don't do <em>X</em>?</li>
</ul>

<h3>To complete this module, submit a list of 5-10 interview questions to your individual Slack channel.</h3>
