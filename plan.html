<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>According to <a href="https://training.npr.org/audio/so-you-want-to-start-a-podcast-read-this-first/">NPR</a>, if you are thinking about starting a podcast you first need to spend time thinking about what you want to make and who you're making it for. Indeed, you need to be <em>intentional</em> and <em>specific</em> about what you are about to set out to do and who will be listening to what you have to say.</p>

<p>This module will help you to start your podcast off on the right foot. And to do that, you will be tasked with completing a Podcast Blueprint assignment. This assignment, based on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R000z-CU1D-3kTg1yD3VELAKjaoE3bbxpzGzZQq61rQ/edit?usp=sharing">NPR Storytelling Project Blueprint</a> from <a href="http://training.npr.org/">NPR Training</a>, is a distillation of what we think are five essential steps in the planning and storytelling phase that will help increase your chances of setting realistic, authentic goals in this workshop.</p>

<h2>The assignment</h2>
<p>Complete the Podcast Blueprint by accessing the document in your individual Slack channel.</p>

<h4>Starting your project</h4>

<p>No matter what format your podcast takes, you will <em>always</em> be telling a story. Your story will manifest in the sound of your voice, the environments in your recording, the words in your script, and the editing of your project. What you say and what you do matters. But we realize that starting a podcast is no small feat and often comes with big ideas with no authentic and feasible way to scope those ideas and make them come to life.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Brainstorm some ideas for your project name. This can be taken from an idea you submitted during the registration process, but feel free to branch out into other ideas, genres, or concepts. Jot down as many ideas as you would like to explore.</p>

            <h4 class="card-title">Step 3: Define your audience.</h4>
            <p class="card-text">Who do you intend to reach with your podcast? It helps to get a sense for who your audience is and some of their needs that you can help meet. For this step, you can think of the general audience as two different subsects: main audiences and supporting audiences. Main audiences are going to be the direct listeners, those who will be downloading your work for their personal consumption. Supporting audiences are those who may also be listening to your work, but are not the "target" audience. For example, your podcast may focus on the latest and greatest in tech gadgetry. Your target audience might be early adopters of technology. Supporting audiences for your show could be those who have a passing interest in tech, developers and vendors of the devices and tools you are reviewing, listeners of similar shows, and so on. While you may have quite a few supporting audiences, you will only have 1 (maybe two) main audience for the project. Assume everyone else is a supporting audience.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Now we're getting into the nitty gritty of your podcast idea. Identify your particular podcast format (interview, solo commentary, narrative stories, or hybrid) and try to provide a summary of what you think you will be making in this workshop. Don't consider this a proposal. Rather, think of this as a conceptual outline of where you want to go in this workshop. This particular stage may seem like a lot to consider - and it is - but know that this is a draft and is meant to provide a broad representation of your podcast's characteristics. </p>

            <p class="card-text">Using the discussion prompts, identify a premise and the best way to support that premise. You will also identify the depth of your story, story elements, a single central question that you are trying to answer. You will also want to revisit your audience to see if this outline continues to meet their needs or if your overall concept has changed.</p>
