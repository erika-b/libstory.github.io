<h3>Record your radio intro</h3>
<p>According to NPR, your <a href="https://training.npr.org/audio/radio-intros-5-examples-of-success/">intro can make or break your story</a> and they are difficult to write. We're going to kick off this workshop with a bang by asking you to record your own radio intro.</p>
<p>Before you begin, get your recording gear in order. This could be a smartphone or USB microphone. Smartphones have access to Voice Memo (iPhone) or Audio Recorder (Android) software. You will also want to download your recording software of choice. We recommend <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>.</p>
    <p>If using Audacity, install the <a href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/faq_installing_the_lame_mp3_encoder.html">LAME MP3 Encoder</a> to export MP3 files. You can view a tutorial for this installation on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EOR_Ub9vUM">YouTube.</a>.</p>
    <p>Using the following script, insert your unique identifiers into the blank:</p>
<blockquote>Hello, and welcome to the UW Libraries Podcasting workshop. This is <em>name</em> reporting for <em>department</em>. I'm here today because <em>reason why you joined this workshop</em>. For more on this story, stay tuned to the UW Libraries Podcasting workshop for details.</blockquote>
    <p>Record yourself reading your script and put it together in Audacity. You may want to check out a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCisC3sHneM">beginners tutorial</a> or go directly to Audacity Manual to learn how to <a href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/play.html">import audio files</a> into your project.</p>
    <p>Export your audio file as an MP3. Remember, you need to download and install the LAME MP3 Encoder if you are using Audacity.</p>
    <p>Upload your MP3 file to your unique Slack channel.</p>
