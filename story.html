<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>In this module, we will continue completing the NPR Storytelling Project Blueprint. Specifically, this will be an opportunity to outline a sample story by using your responses in Part 1 to inform key aspects of your story.</p>

<h4>The assignment</h4>
<p>Complete steps 6-10 of the NPR Project Blueprint. Submit your work to Slack using your individual channel.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Outline a sample episode or story</h2>

<p>Using the discussion prompts found in step 6 (page 9 of the blueprint), you identify key items in your podcast that are essential to moving forward. You will identify a premise and the best way to support that premise. You will also identify the depth of your story and whether or not your research, reporting, scripts and interviews can sustain a 2-5 minute podcast. It's a lot of work to produce a story even as short as this...you'd be surprised!</p>

<p>Some of the prompts will also discuss story elements such as character, universal theme, setting, etc. While your podcast may focus on a specific interview, nonfiction narrative, or news of the day, you will <em>always</em> have a character, a setting, and a universal theme. Thinking in terms of a single central question that you are trying to answer can also be helpful (for example, "what is gerrymandering?" or "was Adnan Syed wrongly convicted?").</p>

<p>You will also want to revisit your audience to see if this outline continues to meet their needs or if your overall concept has changed.</p>

<p>You can include this outline directly in your copy of the blueprint on page 9. Feel free to choose any of the recommended activities (list the ingredients, storyboard, describe formats, etc.) from the second part of step 6.<p>

<h2>Step 7: How might you engage your audience?</h2>

<p>This step will help you work through audience engagement. Not only can you use this step to identify how to connect with your audience (i.e. how they will hear and listen to your podcast) but also how they can interact with <em>you</em>. Brainstorm some ideas using the recommended examples and jot down some ideas that are relevant to your field or personal networks.</p>

<h2>Step 8: What do you need to represent this project on different platforms?</h2>

<p>While we are focused mostly on producing a podcast, it can be helpful to identify the platforms that you will use to promote your work. Chances are, you won't be sending a direct link to your raw audio file. You may want to develop a Soundcloud page or personal website to host your content. Additionally, you may want to include cover art, logos, episode descriptions, and more. We will talk a bit more about metadata in a future module, but this will be a good start to thinking in terms of your resource needs.</p>

<h2>Step 9: Project teams, roles, stakeholders, supports</h2>

<p>You're enrolled in this workshop as an individual, but you will likely be calling on others to support you as you develop your work. That may be through scheduled interviews, equipment sharing, or perhaps you know folks who would like to serve as a host or co-host. Think through the collaborations you may need to get this podcast off the ground. They will be your project team.</p>

<p>You will also list stakeholders and supports. In this workshop, you may have a lack of stakeholders. That's OK! But as you continue craft your podcast project, circle back around to this step and include any stakeholders you identify along the way - people such as a fellow principal investigator, a program director, etc. Supports, on the other hand, are those in your network who can help you review drafts and provide feedback - like this workshop cohort! - and who will motivate you to persist through this project. Supporters are given the smallest column on the page but can have the greatest impact!</p>

<h2>Step 10: Success and its obstacles</h2>

<p>It's a good idea to think about your goals, authentic and measurable milestones, and some of the obstacles that could prevent you from completing them. List both of them here.</p>

<p>"100 retweets" or "10 Soundcloud follows" could be one example of a goal. "Lack of time" could be one examlpe of an obstacle. Identifying your goals and obstacles at this point, having completed the project blueprint, will enable you to recognize the restraints and help you further scope your project.</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<p>We are not requiring you to complete the project roadmap, but we think it could be immensely helpful as you strategize a 3-4 week timeline for your podcast. Do keep in mind that this workshop is also meant to be the <em>beginning</em> of your podcast production. We don't provide the capacity to support an entire season of weekly episodic downloads and for good reason!</p>

<h2>Wrap up</h2>

<p>Podcasting is time consuming and requires a <em>lot</em> of thoughtful planning, writing, and scheduling - as you should understand by now having completed the project blueprint. We do think, however, that it is entirely worth expending the time and energy to explore this genre. We implore you to revisit this document often as your feelings and ideas may change throughout the workshop, particularly during our live sessions.</p>
